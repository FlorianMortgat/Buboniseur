# Buboniseur

## History
I wrote this program in 2004-2005, around the time I found this "new" language named Python. 

Back then, I hadn't heard about PEP8, so the code formatting may look a bit alien to modern-day programmers.

Despite its many flaws, I still like what that program does.

The initial commit is almost faithful to the original (I just replaced the non-free default tune with one
I made up and converted line endings and encoding to unix/utf-8).
